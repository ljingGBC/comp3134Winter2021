Problem 1. Should not be able to view files and folders before html directory
Mitigation: Check if the directory or file exists in the directory AND if the path is anywhere other than where the base is. If both are true, access if forbidden.


Problem 2.Should not attempt to look at folders or filenames that do not exists
Mitigation: Check if the directory or file does not exist inside the base. if it does not exist, inform user about it.
