What is the difference between the two solutions?

Strip tags removes all HTML tags and outputs whatever is left while html_entities encodes characters which are special characters in HTML. 

The problem with strip tags is if JavaScript tag is passed on the URL, JavaScript will execute the scripts. On the other hand, html_entitites will convert all the characters and display to string. This will avoid script tags to execute.
